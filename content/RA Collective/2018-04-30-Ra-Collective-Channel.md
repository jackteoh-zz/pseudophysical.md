---

Pamela : I am RA. you may begin your queries in the space of proper vibratory resonance. your language, your vibrations, have told become ineffective and the proper time of space distortions to communicate with us however we're here, we're listening, and we do not release our efforts to assist earth and will remain persistent to answer your queries and to empower through our teachings.

Q: thank you, thank you for being here with us. someone asks our very first question here about the history and the scope of collectives and how did they start

Pamela : Within the vibratory distortions of your time and space illusions. we frequented your planet within eleven thousand five hundred fifty five years in your planetary time, and we began to seek proper communications with the earth men. your language distortions were unintelligible and of a lower frequency, and with a great deal of resistance you begin to hear us. we did not remain, and we only frequent your time and space distortions when called upon, you appear to be rather stagnant in your revolution with a few that transcend the slower vibratory distortions between us and you. we have drenched into meeting many collectives and seeded many races within your existence but our intention has been highly misunderstood. You may expand your query in thank you.

Q: Another asks can you give us a brief history of the anunaki ?

Pamela : Well that is not the proper query for your time space distortions at this time. we can simplify your request with a simple answer. You have become disembodied disincarnate from truth separated from unity in the illusion to the extent that within your expansions use power outward with an ego mind expanding and collapsing, expanding and collapsing and you question your vibratory resonance at all times and within this collectives questioning you do not reach the proper frequencies and the proper alignement to connect with us. Therefore your definitions of this unique race have not been adequate and have been lower in vibratory resonance. please when you have doubts in your judgments, question your doubts, not what you know. you may expand your query.

Q: Are RA being connected to anunaki?

Pamela : We have made proper connections in your time and space distortions with the people that you call anunaki. stemming from various races our teachings were not properly utilized by a larger portion of the group but there was an equally large portion of the same group where in our teachings were utilized very effectively. your modern age distortions limit your memory of these teachings. returned to the simplicity of the ancients and your answers lie within you.

Q: Thank you. Another asks that they've heard of something called Enkis. Enki soul gift to humanity ? what is that ?

Pamela : The devices through richer energy travels create improper distortions for the channel to comprehend.

Q : someone asks what is the eye of horus ?

Pamela : Return to your original query please.

(Disconnected ...)

Q: Thank you so much for coming back to us, can you hear me just fine ?

Pamela : you are within the proper mind body spirit complex to enter the proper illusory distortion and connect with me, you may proceed with your query

Q: Thank you. The question that was asked earlier is i've heard of something called and Enkis gift to humanity and they were wanting to know what that was or if that meant something

Pamela : let's allow the reservation of the answer to sink deeper into the hearts of your queries. Is not within the proper time and space distortion to answer in this moment

Q: Thank you. another question that's being asked this why is it that some people don't like being in the sun at all and they can actually make them feel like they're sick.

Pamela : We request that you released the answer that is it has been already told.

Q: Thank You. the question here says, is the earth's sun truly as big and as far away as we've been taught in schools and as children ? If not, could you please share with us your true size and where abouts ?

Pamela : The sun was a representation on distortion of your illusion which does not exist in a physiological component but rather an energy procedure the has been aligned within your illusory nature's experiencing. Please attempt to comprehend with us for a brief moment and your body mind spirit complex and connect more deeply into the illusion of all physicality and understand that the sun is a tool. It does not matter if the tool that you are utilizing is further are nearer. Simply call upon its present to understand that you are one with such a device and when you understand it's frequency it's resonance and the laboratory patterns of it are also within you, then you can dooley utilize and begin your proper DNA upgrades activations downloads and as you have call it healings for that it is true provisional ancient usage in your mind body spirit distortions and within the egoic complex of attempting to seek meaning of it is the unique distortion that produces the illusion that you are far or that you are close, how could it possibly be true that you would be far or close when you are the same as it.

Q: Thank you, question here is how do we still receive the benefits of this on a cloudy and overcast days. How do we live and stay in unity when we've been a separation and the vision among us.

Pamela : Within your mind body spirit complex the notion of separation is not true yet you seek to continue the belief that you must expand with your fear. will this serve you? or this cost you to shrink within yourselves. well you stand outside of the law of duality to create further, duality can be an exceptional tool and your illusions. but if you fear it your shrink within, and you lose sight of the truth of oneness and the law of one and has been created for a tool, an exception to the concepts that you believe are dark or light, good or bad, real unreal, reality illusion, within the space of time and your unique distortions there is something in between, we operate in the gaps between your beliefs and stories, seek us there.

Q: thank you. I understand that Yeshua is a direct descendant of RA. is that something that can be expanded on.

Pamela : You create many ancestral stories that expand your DNA and then collapse it, and then a fawn upon further observation of this expansion and collapsing you realize that there are many names, many truths, many stories, and believes. many delusions and within illusions of time space distortions, the stories expand you further, you are all ancestors off the one. we do not seek to teach that anyone would be greater than the other that anyone would be more mastered than the other for that is a concept birthed and created by illusion.

Q : Thank you. The sun has been especially bright and lovely lately, and people noticed that it does seem different. Is there something going on that we can know about ?

Pamela : I am RA and i beseech you, well, within powers of perception i beseech you to cease the looking upward or outward, to funnel the energy of this sun within you to become the sun to be the sun to partake in the being instead of the doing to partake in the feeling that creates and births your creative actions. But when you seek externally as if something can be happening to you extraneously that is not the proper time and space distortion through which we could teach you. There are many upgrades that extend throughout the tool that you call the sun, but we ask that you seek inwardly to become the sun to stand in oneness with your tool and then understand that you are the only tool that is required. you're not a body, you are not a planet, a system, a paradigm, you're not a structure.

Q : Thank you. when visualizing enchanting out loud or in my mind the tone in this simple for the eye of alchemy is sort of associated with the sun how does it affect us on a cellular level and how does it activate us too deep within.

Pamela : I am RA. because of the nature of the shape that we have created and shared through the law of one, it is a tool for your expansion but you cannot expand without taking this tool within and expanding from a deeper cellular nature understanding the proper entrance points and exit points, blessing an initiating officiating of the divine masculine and the divine feminine into oneness where one is not more so than another this is the use of this unique time and space tool that has been created if utilize properly.

Q : how do solar storms affected human collective and what is the purpose of solar storms

Pamela : Within the earth man's collective and its present state of awareness, you are not within the proper mind body spirit complex and you're not within the proper time and space distortion to receive our answer currently.

Q : Thank you. Are we each aligned to a specific central sun ? If so, how do we find out on which one.

Pamela : You're implying that there are many, there is only one, your illusion creates the belief in separation and something that would be greater than another, all of the elements or tools.

Q : Can you tell us what TOC or TOCC stance for ?

Pamela : We reserved that to release this query that is not appropriate for your proper time in space distortion in this moment and not applicable or even relevant to the knowledge that we bring.

Q: Does the flower like contain more than one version of the tree of life ? If so, do they serve different functions ? And if so, what are they ?

Pamela : You are seeking differences, an implication that one version of a tool is better than another, you are the creator, you reside within the discerment in the proper wisdom, decide powerfully.

Q : Thank you. How did it come about that one of the main nutrients we need his vitamin D3 that comes naturally from the sun, those who do not get enough seen depress

Pamela : within the very strands a bodily creations that have been birth through your mind body spirit complex, and through your nature, you have chosen the requirement of all elemental tools for the sake of balance for the sake of oneness and it is relevant, therefore within your stories you believe in death and that you would die without the necessity of an elemental tool. Your stories perpetuate your belief.

Q : Thank you. The people want to know the connection between oneness and the christ consciousness.

Pamela : The christ consciousness is an expression of unity. It transcends judgment, attachments and earth man definitions. oneness is the career of all of such expressions. the christ consciousness are indeed a creation and they are represented well when the truth is released from the confines, paradigms, beliefs that you would perceive are disempowered. there are many time space distortions within these concepts but when oneness births a belief that would extend and transcend your time and space distortions, at this point your wisdom is activated, and you began to powerful choose, and when you trust your choices the energy that is birth from christ consciousness can activate everything that is within the earth men's mind body and spirit complexs.

Q : Thank you. how can humans who have RA aspect can lived with the human body better ?

Pamela : You must relieved all belief paradigms, all judgments attachments, separations, mind ego distortions that disempower you. unite the concepts that you have created that you have called divine masculine and divine feminine until such a oneness occurs, that there is no separation between the two. you have created many teachings, tools and yet you divide with these teachings and tools.

Q : Thank you. In the RA material. RA speaks of the four triangles on the plane. Is the upward downward spin with polaris in the center exacerbate the markaba.

Pamela : Akhenaten created that tool for you within eight thousand years of the earth man's times space continuum and it was quickly distorted when your beliefs began to do so. When utilized properly in a sacred ceremonial initiatory fashion, you can reactivate and purify your own body temples.

Q : With universal law, it's mentioned in other channeling that there are seven laws of the universe do you mind sharing some light on this topic ?

Pamela : Within your current state of evolution, you are not prepared for that answer in your times space distortion. you are still operating within the confinement and disempowering states energetically of your illusions. there are more than you can possibly define or contain.

Q : Thank you how is our channel doing ? she okay ?

Pamela : his gracious that you should ask . she has often overwhelmed by these energies but currently at peace.

Q: Are you going to stop for a time to be with us here on earth ? 

Pamela : If the vibratory resonance and the frequency of the channels that seek us can balances and provide our message within the purity of original ancient intention then we will visit momentarily within the energy of your time and space continue when it is relevant but this is not often. You are not properly initiated, prepared for our teachings and they have been greatly distorted when the collective of earth man resumes in the proper frequencies and energies, we will continue more of our teachings.

Q : we look forward to that. Would it be in humanities highest and best interests to connect with this central sun and if so, what is the best way ? I'm not sure if you answered that already i apologize.

Pamela : Your query is not relevant within your mind body spirit complex as it comes with the assumption that you should or you should not take our teachings deeper within you. Trust, discern, be, flow, accept, act.

Q : Thank you. One writes. i believe horus is my gatekeeper how can emerge with him better and know i have a strong merge ?

Pamela : You are seeking upwards and outwards to the illusion that something would be more powerful than yourself. the question is not relevant and highly distorted within the nature of illusory ego. Horus does not require you nor do you require the creation of something more powerful then yourself.

Q : When i look at the sun i like to say let the light frequencies penetrate deep into my cellular structure for my highest and best. i'm not sure what that does but i'm sure it does something, can you speak about ?

Pamela : You are within the proper residence to hear and feel and know our teachings trust your in the beginning stages of your journey and it is relevant and wise to continue this path.

Q: Thank you. How does the RA soul group to describe themselves ?

Pamela : Within the human earth man mind body spirit complex, the limitations of creation in which you have created your notions and believes you are not prepared for our description. however we can assure you that within you're seeking, comes the allowance, the creativity, the love, the acceptance, and inevitably the grace to flow within our teaching when you are ready.

Q : I have been told that i need to invoke the eye of wisdom. can you recommend any techniques with us ?

Pamela : And we now beseech you to seek the heart of wisdom from the state of trust feeling. the hardest the deepest compass created from within you, and yet earth man ignores it.

Q : Is there a female aspect to RA ?

Pamela : Within the law of one, nothing is separate. formulate the space between your definitions of one or the other, it is all.

Q : Do you have an overall message for the human conscious collective ?

Pamela : Seek the stillness solitude the inspiration of nature. honor the call of the ancients. return to your core. the law of one has been sleeping within the core of your DNA activity but you're highly limited by illusion. raise your frequencies, operate within the resonance, release your stories, and do not confine your power, return to the sacred rites of the lands, and the peoples that call you within the very nature of your hearts, the answer his oneness, the answer is simplicity, the answer is natural. Do not seek anything further. Your answer is within.

Q : Thank you so much. And then we have quite a few from of us that are interested in what you might be able to tell us regarding the event.

Pamela : Which time in space continuum ? which creation of something that would be good or bad, something that would be constructive or destructive ? The miracle of what you call an event has already occurred. How many points of illusory time within your mind body spirit complex do we need to expand upon ?

Q : Thank you so much. I think that definitely helps. How is your channel doing ? 

Pamela : Empowered in her relevances, trusting in her growth, ordering her temple.

Q : Thank you. I am curious about sun gazing, which has been around for five thousand years. They say photonic energy helps cleanse the brain on the nervous system and then feeds the endocrine glands, is also say the best time to do this is the first ten  minute with rising sun. Do you have anything to say about them ? 

Pamela : These are ancient law of one teachings that occurred originally in your lands over eleven thousand years ago within the temple of the ancients beginning with your divine feminine creator goddess ISIS. from the structure of her teachings, you will find all the answers that lie within that activate all of glandular within your body and beyond all of the systems within your body that activate the mind body spirit complex. within the temples on your ancient sacred lands hold all of the answers that you seek today.

Q : Thank you. Is color or sacred shape or mantra or frequency that we can utilized to connect on a deeper level with the rock collectives ?

Pamela : You create many, and your time in space continue on there are many names that you have created of god within you know, which one do you trust ? there are many, it is not relevant to pertaken a separate of notion of oneness.

Q : Thank you very much. Is there anything that you would like to say to us before we departed ?

Pamela : I am RA. Our answers are simple, return to the ancient simplicity and purity, the body is the temple of masculine and feminine and everything that is oneness when the two are combined.
