# Meditation - Travel

This was a few months ago when we have a class on guided meditation and i saw myself in a pod look like the picture below. I focus on the center crystal and a energy portal open and i went throught it. Next, I was traveling/flying forward where i see tree lines below my left and right, dark skies with start above me.
