Today was an evenful meetup. It was my first time experience this in person. When i first walked in , i have a message from the organizer. You are open but not ready... I was supprise and i know that i am open to learn and to experience but was not ready to take the next step yet because i felt that i still have more to learn and take care of my own personal development. The most bizzare event was she had a message to tell me on my own knowing and i did not said anything about it.

Next was the energy and healing session for a lady that attended. I was just an audieance sitting on the south east of the room. The lady was on the floor resting face up with the head on the north side of the room. There were 4 people sitting around her, each on the north, south, east and west of the lady. Long story short, there was tons of energy flowing throughout the room and i felt it.
