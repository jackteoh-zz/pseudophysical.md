## Online Akashi Reading/Energy Work with Aurora

I needed some spiritual guidance during this times when i was lost in life, it was a wonderfull session where i get answer for some very deep question that i have and i need some confirmation of what is that and what i need to do. 

## Lesson

Speak my truth confidently with elegent in respecful way
Speak my heart confidently with elegent in respecful way
Speak my thought confidently with elegent in respecful way

At time i am too analytical and controlling, choose the most peaceful manner to get my point across.

## Choice

I have the free will to choose to learn my lesson and be done with it or repeat it again. I prefer to learn my lesson and not repeat in another life to learn it again.

## Spiritual Guide

Buddha and GuanYin are my 2 major guides appeared during the session.
Start connecting to my guide again. Start meditation.
Slowdown and pay attention to love ones.
Calling on guide to reconnecting with them.
Ask in mind and heart, talk to self.
Potential for expension, ready to expend.
Slowdown, focus, follow my heart, create what i desire and believe it.
Follow what make my heart happy. I will be always be provided.
Imagine leaf on the river, allow the the river drift me to whatever take me. life is like a beautiful dance, follow the rythem. I am beautiful and loved. Stand Strong , Be fearless. 
Living in grace and love. by being in gratitude, i am going to start receiving wave of grace.
Live in the frequency of grace

## Creation

Set intent and creation. Living in the ideal frequency of grace and gratitude. I am my own creator, focus on what i want and not the negative. 

## Past/Present Life

I am/was a buddhist monk that ascended. I am/was the guardian/gate keeper of the sacred portal in the higher dimension. I guard the gate to ensure only those who are ascended in the frequency of light/love love/light can enter, monks go there to get information throught me.

## Path

Since i started my spiritual journey, I have been eating less meat due to multiple incident where i get pretty sick.
Once i reach the love/light light/love frequency, it will be a rebirth like the phoenix.

## Sacred Alchemy Symbols

Awaken memories and code within. Don't let ego get into the way.

## Far Future

Tai Chi, Qi Gong. Create new modality that incorporate with breathing and moving energy around. A teacher. A sensei.

## Crystal

Talk to all my crystal, ask and whichever i look at or touch will be the one that i communicate. Take about 1 minute for the communication or 4 min in meditation with the crystal in my palm.

## Dragons

I am ancient and i have an ancient green serpentine dragon with mustache that is as old as me. He is male and a fractal of me. He is me and i am him. My dragon created a bridge connection of my mind's eye with my heart center for further expension.
