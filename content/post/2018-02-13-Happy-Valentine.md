Love is not chocolate,not teddy bear and definitely not roses.There are no amount of material can quantify love because it is a feeling, is the connection, is the warm that one give to other self and it is a safe space where we share this wonderful and joyous feeling. Here is a little token of appreciation that we wish to bring you the warm, wonderful and joyous feeling of love.

Happy Valentine !
