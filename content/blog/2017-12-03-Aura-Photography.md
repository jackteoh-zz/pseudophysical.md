![Aura](/images/Jack_Auras_120317.jpg)

My auras taken at the local holistic festival at the booth. I sat down on the chair facing the camera in a rectangle metal box with a glass panel. Placing my both palm on each side on the device facing down and touching the metal sensor. A yellow spot light shining at me while i am getting ready for my photo to be taken. I am ready ! Is done ! I walked over to the table to pay for my photo while waiting for my picture appear on the white photo.

The lady explain to me the color and meaning of the aura around me then she ask me, have i been working with healing for the past 3 months.
I pause a little bit to think and i answer was i have been working with energy. Yes. Yes.

What i learned is everyone emit aura because we are a form of vibration. I can't see but technology can and this photo has proven it.
