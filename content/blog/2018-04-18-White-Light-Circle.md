There were 6 of us, Estella, Rosa, Dina, MJ, Teresa and me in the class today. I am sharing only my part of this class.

# Meditation

We started with guided meditation. Sit in a relax position and close your eye. Take a few deep breath from your nose and out your mouth then continue to breath normally, listen to your breath and listen to your physical heart...

# Vision
