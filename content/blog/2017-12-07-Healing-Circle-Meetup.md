There were 7 of us in this circle today. It was my first time attend this group and i am getting more comortable meeting people for the first time and be able to express my thought in words. The session started with creating energy bubble or sphere with hand. I started perform my own little bubble i learned from Aurora(Rising Phonix Aurora) to protect me becuase i have no idea what i will be experiencing during this session.

Next was a kind of healing with the receiver of energy in the middle and the provider form a circle around it. It was a husband and wife sitting on the chair facing each other. I was sitting on the outside with others forming a circle while other where standing around them. I was told to just holding space which i don’t know what that's really mean so i just sat on the chair and trying to meditate. After their session , everyone was ask to share and it was also my turn and i speak out what i saw during my eye close during this healing session. Most of the time, i don’t know what i see during my eye close so i don’t say much. The first image that i saw was pharos from egypt then i saw a few other scene that was related to egypt. I keep asking why am i keep seeing this during my eye close in my mind. The respond i get from the men who was in the middle was profound, he has a deep connection with egypt and somehow i see image of it.

Today, i learned that i am able to see with my eyes close which some people say seeing with the third eye. My issue was, is this my conscious mind messing around or i actually can see with my third eye. That is my question that i am still discovering and learning.
