April 29th, 2018 is consider the Pink Full Moon. This moon is powerful since we are moving into the spring/summer. The Moon moves into scorpio! Let's get to manifesting.

# Ritual:

## Things you need:
- The list of things to release. 
- The list of intentions. 
- Matches/lighter 
- Make sure you keep a copy of both lists that way you can see what comes and go out of your world. 

Position yourself in front of the moon and calling in your guides/angles/people/whoever is willing to help in. 

Say: “Please release the following in the highest good with love and compassion” read your list and then close with “its done” three times. (seals it in). 

With everyone still in position.. Say “Please bring the following into my life in the highest good with love and compassion” read your list of intentions and then close with “its done” Three times (seal it in). 

Close with the following “Thank you for all my guides,angles,ancestors,and my higher self for being here tonight. Thank you thank you thank you” (seal it in).  

Burn the paper. You can let the ashes float away into the wind or burn and flush it down the toilet. 

## Meditation:

Go to your safe place and see your foundation of life. It can be anything you like..walk over to the foundation and throw it in the air so it’s above you floating. Looks for any holes or cracks. Begin to fill those holes and cracks with all your intentions it can be anything you like. Make sure everything is filled. Then call in your spirit animal ask them to in case/wrap your foundation of life. Once it’s done that them and float as high above the foundation- go super far keep your eyes on the foundation. Then with all your speed go straight towards the foundation and push it into Mother Earth. Once it hits Mother Earth if any pieces came off ask your guides what that means for you. This could mean anything!!! This is your foundation to build on. This meditation can be done on the full and new moon! Happy full moon!!!!!!
