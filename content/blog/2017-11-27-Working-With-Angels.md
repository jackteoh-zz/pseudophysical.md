## Angel Fundementals
- The world Angel means messenger of God.
- Angels are pure beings, their role is to support us, yo guide us and to love us. They hover near and all about.
- They are found in most religions and are non-denominational beings who love us wheather we believe in them or not.
- There are many types of Angels but you are giben one Guardian Angel that never leaves your sight.
- Angels love to send us signs to let us know they are with us. They'll use anything they can to highlight their presense with symbols and signs that come in all shapes and sizes.

## Stating your own relationship with the Angel
- Angels work under a spiritual law known as "free woll" which means they will start making themselves known more once you welcome them in.
- Once you make the choice to accept their help and welcome them into your lives, you'll begin to notice the sigins and the miracles they do in your life.
- Fears and old beliefs will prevent you from making direct connection with your Angels. Thise would be the two reasons why many people don't experience the Angel's love and support.
- They'll remove the barriers around your heart and help you align with your true self, the self that loved and is loved.
- Breaking down barriers of fear will help you to easily open up to the Angels help.
Believing in Angels doesn't have to be a public display, it can be as private as you like.
- Don't fear, Angels won't jump out and scare you, their energy is subtle showing you loving signs.

## Simple Prayer to Welcome Angels
Thank you Angels for joining me in my journey. It is good to know that you are real and are with me. I welcome you into my life to guide me and to show me a more loving and fulfilled life. With your help I let go of all the barriers that prevent me from allowing your loving presense in my life. I open my heart to love from this day forward. And so it is! Again, Thank you Angels!
