# Guardian Angel
We are assigned our Guardian Angel at birth and are you protector and guide. We connect with them even before we come to Earth, our soul knows our Guardian Angel. Their energy is very subtle and they will not do anything to scare you. They connect with you through mind and intuition. They are always next to you giving you their love and support. When you connect with your Guardian Angel, they remind you of your life purpose and things you've forgotten

# Exercise to connect with your Guardian Angel
- Sit quietly and focus your breath and relax
- Start inhale with your nose, raise your chest and expend your stomach when breading in, hold your breath for few second then blow out from yout mouth slowly. Do this for about 3 time then breath normal.
- Ground yourself by picturing roots coming out of your feet into ground or you can picture the roots from your root chakra then bring your energy back to your heart
- Visualize a golden light surrounding you
- Welcome your Gourdian Angel and ask them to reveal themselves to you
- once they reveal themselves to you, take note of its appearance
- Ask for the name
- Ask how they communicate with you so that you know it's them and not any other Angel or guide
- Ask if they have a message or gift for you
- Thank them for their presence
