This is reference to the movie Inception (2010) by Christophor Nolan. The concept of multiple levels depth of dreams within dreams. This same concept can be apply to multiple level of entities attachment and healing.

When people talk about entities attachment, it never cross my mind that there were entity attach to entity then attach to a third density being(human). I always view as only single level of attachment like some energy attach to a person but that is not true. There can be multiple level of attachment and multiple entities attach at different level. It become very convoluted like [Delores Cannon](https://dolorescannon.com/) book's Convoluted Universe.

Entities sometimes may appear to be negative or evil but it is not true because there are cases where the moment when they pass away, they may be in pain and the pain carried over and when they attached to another being, it appear to be evil but their true form was good. This entity that was in pain may be cause by another entity who was also in pain when passing over and attach to this entity. This sound very crazy but this video tells the story.

Healing also can be perform on this multiple level dimension and density. It is like peeling the onion skin layer by layer and heal each layer until it is fully clear. The work that [Alba Weinman](http://albaweinman.com/) where amazing.
